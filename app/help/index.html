3. Inmate-Managed Accounts:
A. PIN Debit Prepaid Phone Accounts
<h5>Q. What is an Inmate PIN Debit Account used for?</h5>
A. The Inmate PIN Debit Account is used by the Inmate to pay for phone calls to friends and family members. Inmates may call any telephone number permitted by their facility using their PIN Debit Account. The Inmate may fund this account themselves from their commissary or trust account. In addition, some facilities permit Friends and Family members to deposit funds directly to an Inmate�s PIN Debit Account, thereby allowing the Inmate to control and budget their phone calls. The �Locations� tab on ConnectNetwork will indicate the facilities where this is permitted.

Note that because this is an Inmate-controlled account you will not be able to find out the account balance except by asking the Inmate. Once the Inmate is released, any remaining balance in the account will be refunded to the Inmate.

<h5>Q. How can I deposit funds to an Inmate PIN Debit Account through ConnectNetwork?</h5>
A. After logging in to ConnectNetwork, select the �Offender Phone Account� from the left side panel and follow the instructions. Those facilities which allow friend & family deposits to Inmate PIN Debit accounts will be indicated under the �Locations� link.

You will need the Inmate's PIN number in order to make a deposit into their account on either the ConnectNetwork website or the voice response unit. If you don't know the PIN number, you may look it up online at ConnectNetwork.com for most facilities or you may also check the facility�s website.

<h5>Q. How will I know if my Inmate PIN Debit Account deposit has been accepted?</h5>
A. You will receive a confirmation email telling you that your deposit amount was accepted and posted to the offender account you specified.

<h5>Q. How does the Inmate know that I have deposited funds into his/her PIN Debit Account?</h5>
A. The Inmate can attempt to make a telephone debit call and will be informed at the beginning of that call of the money residing in the account. If that person wants to confirm that a specific deposit has been made without attempting a call, he/she can do so by making an inquiry using an automated process associated with the telephones used within the facility.

<h5>Q. How do I view my PIN Debit Phone Account statement online?</h5>
A. After you�ve logged into your ConnectNetwork account, click on the �Statement� link in the left side panel under the Offender Phone Account heading. Note that you will see your own deposit history but will not be able to view the account balance.

B. TRUST FUND Accounts

<h5>Q. Can inmates use funds I deposit in their Trust Fund Account to call me?</h5>
A. No. Phone calls cannot be paid for from an Inmate Trust Fund Account. The inmate must first put funds into their Inmate PIN Debit phone account before it can be used to make phone calls.

<h5>Q. How do I view my Offender Trust Fund Statement online?</h5>
A. After you�ve logged into your ConnectNetwork account, click on the �Statement� link in the left side panel under the Offender Trust Account heading. Note that you will see your own deposit history but will not be able to view the account balance.

<h5>Q. How soon after I make a deposit to an inmate will they receive the money?</h5>

To find out when the inmate has received your funds, click on the Recent Activity under the Offender Trust Fund menu. At the bottom of the screen, under the Per Transaction section, there is a Payment Status table. This table will provide you with an up-to-date status on your current transactions.

An Accepted status  shows when the inmate has received the funds.

A Pending status  shows when the facility has received your funds but has not yet updated the inmate's account.

A Rejected status  shows when your money transfer was not completed.


<h5>Q. How can I deposit funds to an Inmate Trust Account through ConnectNetwork?</h5>

5. Product Information
A. Phone Service

<h5>Q. What are the rates for my phone calls?</h5>
A. Rates vary by facility. To find out what your rates are, listen to the prompts (when the inmate calls you) and press the corresponding number to verify the call rates before you accept the incoming call. You may also contact Customer Service to request the rates for your Facility.

<h5>Q. In addition to the cost of the call, what other fees may apply?</h5>
A. GTL is a regulated telecommunications service that is required to remit payments to both state and federal government agencies to help fund the general agency oversight of all of the telecommunications industry. GTL is required to submit to the federal government a percentage of the money it receives from completing calls to support the Universal Service Fund. The amount of mandatory contribution is determined by the federal government and changes every quarter. This fluctuating percentage is applied to the cost of every call. The FCC also requires telecommunications carriers to contribute to the Local Number Portability fund that enables people to keep their phone number while switching phone services. Contributions are also required to the fund that ensures that phone service is available to those with hearing disabilities. Many states maintain their own Universal Service Fund, which is separate from the federal USF, and the mandatory contribution into state funds fluctuates, as well. In addition to the federal and state universal service funds, GTL files mandatory payments at the state level to help the states fund their operations. Where permitted by the pertinent agency, GTL assesses a fee to recoup the cost of these contributions and the expense invested in complying with these requirements. State and federal taxes that are collected are marked as such on a paper bill, or deducted from the balance of prepaid accounts on a per-call basis in the form of a percentage of the cost of the call. Federal USF charges are marked as such, and apply in the same manner as taxes. The recoupment of the administrative cost of complying with the federal USF program appears separately on a paper bill, as does the line for recoupment of state regulatory administrative compliance. In states that require tariffs, these state charges are authorized by the state public utility agency, and they appear in GTL�s tariffs. For accounts that are paperless, the fee is calculated as a percentage of the cost of a call, which percentage will fluctuate as the various fees assessed by agencies fluctuate, but will not exceed 5%.

Calls to cell phones may be assessed a surcharge of 4% of the cost of the call, exclusive of taxes and fees.

<h5>Q. Can I call the inmate or does the inmate always have to call me?</h5>
A. Calls can only be made from the inmate to the Phone Number(s) you have setup on your account. You are not able to call the inmate directly.

<h5>Q. What if my call is cut off or disconnected?</h5>
A. If your call is cut off or disconnected prematurely less than 5 minutes after you were connected, you may contact Customer Service to request an investigation. You will need to identify the date/time of the call as well as the facility and the inmate's first and last name.

During the investigation, we will review the phone call and determine the issue. If the disconnection is not due to a fault on the phone lines, you will NOT be credited for the call and you will be charged a $5.00 investigation fee. Investigations will not be made on any calls longer than 5 minutes or calls made to a cell phone.

Refunds for calls which are cut off or disconnected prematurely are subject to our Refund Policy below.

<h5>Q. Can I use a cell phone to receive calls?</h5>
A. Each facility has different rules regarding allowing calls to be made to cell phones. Contact your facility to learn their policy regarding cell phones.

If your facility approves the use of cell phones, you may add the number to your Phone Account. Custom ringback tones (the sound heard by the calling party when they dial your number) may prevent your call from being received and could possibly put a block on your phone number. It is advised that you remove all custom ringback tones on your phone.

Refunds for calls to a cell phone which are cut off or disconnected prematurely are subject to our Refund Policy below.

<h5>Q. What is your refund policy for calls which are cut off or disconnected prematurely?</h5>
A.There are NO refunds for calls which are cut off or disconnected prematurely, or for calls with poor voice quality, made to cell phones, or processed through any type of call forwarding service or a movable (nomadic) Internet-based telephone service (such as Google Voice or majicJack). All other refund requests will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

<h5>Q. How do I block my phone number from an inmate and/or facility?</h5>
A. You may block your phone number from an inmate and/or facility by listening to the prompts on the line and pressing the corresponding number to have the inmate and/or facility blocked.

You may also request your number to be blocked by printing a copy of your phone bill and mailing it to us. The copy of the bill must show that you are the owner of the phone line by including the page with your name, address, and the phone number. On your bill, you will need to write: "I want my calls blocked from ______ facility". Then sign and date your request before mailing it to: PO Box 2868, Mobile, AL 36652. If you want multiple phone numbers blocked from a specific facility, you must send a copy of each phone bill for each phone number you want blocked. Please note: If you block your phone number, it will be blocked from receiving calls from all facilities served by GTL, DSI, PCS, and VAC.

<h5>Q. Why are my calls being blocked? How do I unblock my phone number?</h5>
A. If you are being billed for collect calls from inmates on your monthly phone bill from your local phone provider, then either the local phone provider has blocked your number or you may have exceeded the collect limit for your facility. In either case, you will need to set up and fund an AdvancePay Prepaid Phone Account.

If you already have an AdvancePay Account and calls are not being received, check to make sure you have sufficient funds in the account. If there are insufficient funds in your account to pay for a 5 minute call, then the call will not be completed. Check the rates for your phone calls to ensure you meet the minimum requirement for a five minute phone call.

If you have enough money on your AdvancePay Account and your calls are still being blocked, please contact Customer Service to request your number be unblocked. They will determine the reason for the block. If it is the result of a customer requested block, in order to unblock your phone number, we will need your account Passcode, as well as the name and address listed on the account. Your phone number will be unblocked within one business day. If the block is a result of a technical problem, it may take a few business days to resolve.

If you intentionally blocked your phone number from an inmate and/or a facility, and you now want it unblocked, you will need to mail a copy of your phone bill to us. Include the page of the bill that shows you are the owner of the phone with your name, address, and phone number on it. On the bill, you will need to write: "I want to unblock calls from _______ facility". Sign and date the request before mailing it to: PO Box 2868, Mobile, AL 36652.

If your number was blocked by the Facility, you must contact the Facility to have your number unblocked.

B. Phone Service - Notice to NY DOC Customers

NOTICE TO FRIENDS AND FAMILIES OF NEW YORK STATE INMATES
Unisys Corporation, and Value Added Communications (VAC) through a contract with the New York State Department of Correctional Services provide an inmate telephone system at each state operated facility within New York State.

The calling rate is less than a nickel ($.048) per minute for all calls terminating within the United States, Canada, and US Territories (American Samoa, Federated states of Micronesia, Guam, Midway Islands, Puerto Rico, and US Virgin Islands) and there are no additional call set-up or connect fees. A card transaction fee will apply. The chart below shows the calling rate for the average twenty minute call.

Description	New Rate
Set-up fee per call	$0.00
Charge per minute	$.048
Cost of a 20 minute call	$0.96


Note: Historical data indicates that the average call lasts twenty minutes in length. The maximum call duration allowed is determined by the facility. Most facilities allow each call to last thirty minutes.

In 2007 the New York State legislature passed a law that permanently eliminates commissions paid to the State for inmate calls. This law further stipulates that the phone contract must allow for collect and pre-paid calling services. Both of these services are included in the calling service contract. Please note that the Department of Corrections does not provide inmate-paid debit calling at this time.

The first time an inmate calls each of the numbers on their allowed list, the calling system will attempt to complete the call and bill it as a collect call on the called party�s phone bill. If the call cannot be completed because there is no billing arrangement with the called party�s telephone company or for some other restriction, an automated system will prompt the called party to set up a pre-paid account with Value Added Communications. Effective Jan 1, 2014 calls from inmates to cell phones will be allowed, as long as the cell phone is associated with an AdvancePay prepaid phone account which has complete name and address information.

If there are any problems or questions you can contact Value Added Communications (VAC) at 1-800-777-2522 or on the internet at www.ConnectNetwork.com. If a prepaid account is established it can be reviewed, managed, and funded via the 800 number or the internet address. Friends and families may also set-up or fund pre-paid accounts via a credit card or by mailing in a Money Order or Cashiers Check to: Value-Added Communications, Inc. Dept. #2548, PO Box 122548, Dallas, TX 75312-2548 . In the memo line, input the ten digit phone number that you would like the funds to be placed on in order to receive pre-paid collect calls.
